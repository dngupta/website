# Biography

<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a recent SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow at Memorial University. My research programme addresses geospatial and digital methods in post-colonial and Indigenous archaeology. My research specialties are geovisualization and GIS, post-colonial and Indigenous studies, and the archaeology of India and Canada.</div>

<p> <div style="text-align: justify"> I am particularly interested in the relationship between knowledge, space and power, and how geospatial perspectives can shed new light on Indigenous peoples in Canada and India. Recent scholarship such as <a href="http://dngupta.github.io/mina.github.io" target="_blank"> MINA | Map Indian Archaeology</a> and <a href="http://wendatcircles.org" target="_blank"> Circles of Interaction </a> centers on the themes of colonial practices in archaeology, web maps and geographic visualization, and the relationship between Indigenous peoples and archaeology. </div></p>
