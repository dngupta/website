# Biography

<p><div style="text-align: justify"> I am Assistant Professor in Anthropology at The University of British Columbia. My research programme addresses geospatial and digital methods in post-colonial and Indigenous archaeology. My research specialties are geovisualization and GIS, post-colonial and Indigenous studies, and the archaeology of India and Canada.</div></p>

<p> <div style="text-align: justify"> I am particularly interested in the relationship between knowledge, space and power, and how geospatial perspectives can shed new light on Indigenous peoples in Canada and India. Recent scholarship such as <a href="http://dngupta.github.io/mina.github.io" target="_ blank"> MINA | Map Indian Archaeology </a>, <a href="https://dngupta.github.io/project/circles-wendat/" target="_ blank"> Circles of Interaction </a> and <a href="https://o-date.github.io/draft/book/" target="_ blank"> Open Digital Archaeology Textbook and Environment </a> centers on the themes of colonial practices in archaeology, web maps, open research practice and the relationship between Indigenous peoples and archaeology.</div></p>
