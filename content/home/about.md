# Biography

<p><div style="text-align: justify"> I am Assistant Professor in Anthropology at The University of British Columbia. My research programme addresses geospatial and digital methods in post-colonial and Indigenous archaeology. My research interests are geovisualization and GIS, post-colonial and Indigenous studies, and the archaeology of India and Canada.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align: justify"> I am particularly interested in the relationship between knowledge, space and power, and how geospatial perspectives can re-center the views and narratives of Indigenous peoples and racialized groups in archaeology. Recent scholarship such as [MINA | Map Indian Archaeology](http://dngupta.github.io/mina.github.io), [Circles of Interaction](https://dngupta.github.io/project/circles-wendat/), [Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment](https://o-date.github.io/draft/book/) and [syilx Digital Heritage Governance](https://dngupta.github.io/project/syilx-digital/) focus on the themes of colonial practices in archaeology, Indigenous data governance principles, Web maps, and digital method and practice in archaeology.</div></p>
