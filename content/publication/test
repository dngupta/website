abstract = "Archaeologists are often considered frontrunners in employing spatial
approaches within the social sciences and humanities, including geospatial
technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) that are now routinely
used in archaeology. Since the late 1980s, GIS has mainly been used to
support data collection and management as well as spatial analysis and modeling.
While fruitful, these efforts have arguably neglected the potential contribution
of advanced visualization methods to the generation of broader archaeological
knowledge. This paper reviews the use of GIS in archaeology from a
geographic visualization (geovisual) perspective and examines how these
methods can broaden the scope of archaeological research in an era of more
user-friendly cyber-infrastructures."
abstract_short = "Recent developments in geographic visualization are pertinent in the globalized world as archaeologists amass vast new bodies of georeferenced information and work towards integrating them with traditional archaeological data. Greater effort in developing geovisualization and geovisual analytics appropriate for archaeological data can create opportunities to visualize, navigate, and assess different sources of information within the larger archaeological community, thus enhancing possibilities for collaborative research and new forms of critical inquiry."
