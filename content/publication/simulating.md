abstract = "This volume is being published in an atmosphere of renewed simulation activity in archaeology. Just in the past couple of years, a significant number of major articles that feature simulation as a tool have been published in mainstream journals (among others: Brantingham et al. 2007; Conolly et al. 2008; Lenoble et al. 2008; Mesoudi and Oâ€™Brien 2008a, 2008b; Whitehead et al. 2008; Wilkinson et al. 2007). In fact, the rate of publication of simulation articles in archaeology is starting to approach that of the heyday of the mid-1970s. This is a significant change from the situation that prevailed as little as five years ago. It remains to be seen whether this trend will continue."
