abstract = "A recent news focus on Pakistani and Indian archaeology appearing in the pages of Science suggests a largely isolated development of the discipline in the two countries (Lawler 2008). This very significant interest in the Indus Valley civilisation (Basu 2008) presents an opportunity to discuss the development of this field in the twentieth century and to examine the factors that have shaped the practice of contemporary archaeology in Pakistan and India."
