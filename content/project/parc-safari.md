summary = "The project was a collaboration between archaeologists and geographers at McGill University. The project aimed to develop tools and technologies in the detection of clandestine graves for the investigation of human rights abuses. The team carried out interdisciplinary field studies at an animal cemetery that Parc Safari had used between the 1970s and early 2000s. Parc Safari is a zoological park in Hemmingford, Quebec."

[Parc Safari Burial Detection] (https://sites.google.com/site/excavationsatparcsafari/) (opens new window) was a collaboration between scholars in the departments of anthropology and of geography at McGill University and Parc Safari. Parc Safari is a zoological park located in Hemmingford, Quebec, Canada, specializing in African fauna. The team collected information on the locations of graves, the dates that graves were created and the occupants of graves was not available, a situation that is similar to clandestine graves created to conceal human rights abuses. The cemetery therefore offered a real-world analogue for scholars to develop tools and technologies to facilitate burial detection and documentation.

As part of an archaeological field school, undergraduate and graduate students carefully excavated the grave of a watusi. Watusi is a large-horned cow typically found in Africa.

Students documented the excavation using traditional notebooks, digital photography, as well as a total station. High-precision data collected on the total station were processed in ArcGIS, a GIS software. The images below are a 2.5D model of the grave, and the watusi's skeletal remains within it. Such representations can enable insights into burial practices.
