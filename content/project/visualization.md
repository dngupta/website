summary = "UBC Okanagan and Open Context have developed an interactive visualization that can be used to learn about digital archaeological collections. The team is comprised of Dr Neha Gupta (CCGS), Dr Fatemah Fard (CS), Dr Eric Kansa (Open Context) and Mohammad Hadi, a graduate student in Computer Science. Visualizations summarize large amounts of digital information and allow options like grouping and filtering of data. With interactive tools, Indigenous peoples, archaeologists and members of the public can engage with digital archaeological information."

Government agencies increasingly share digital data as part of their commitments to Open Government. While well intended, this information is often shared in formats and ways that are not easily understood by non-specialists, Indigenous peoples and members of the general public. They cannot readily use government data to make informed decisions. To this end, UBC Okanagan and [Open Context] (http://www.opencontext.org) have developed an interactive visualization of digital archaeological collections that enable insights into archaeological heritage. Interactive visualizations summarize information, and allow navigation of large volumes of data. These tools can implemented and developed for a range of digital archaeological collections.

Interact with the [visualization] (https://observablehq.com/@mohammad-abdul-hadi/open-context-force-directed-graph-with-tooltip-motif-to-dec). The visualization demonstrates the co-occurrence between motifs and decoration techniques on pottery from the [Poggio Civitate digital collection](https://opencontext.org/projects/DF043419-F23B-41DA-7E4D-EE52AF22F92F). Orange nodes represent motifs and decorative techniques are blue nodes. Edges or lines connecting nodes represent counts of co-occurrences. The thicker the edges, the greater the number of co-occurrences.

The project is funded by the [UBC Okanagan Public Humanities Impact Award] (https://public-humanities.ok.ubc.ca/2020/09/15/impact-award-project-interactive-visualization-of-digital-archaeological-collections-on-open-context/).
