summary = "The Training and Human Resources Development Project at McGill University aimed to address inequalities in the availability of health and social services for linguistic minorities in Quebec, Canada. The project is based on the principle that a person must have access to health and social services in their first language. Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French-speaking majority. The project focused on service availability for English-speakers, a linguistic minority in the province."

In Phase 1 of this complex multi-year project, I characterized the spatial relationship between health and social service providers and linguistic-minorities in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Because the project aimed to address service inequities through training, the first phase of the project centered on identifying where services for English-speakers were lacking.

The spatial analysis was necessary to better understand the geographic distribution of services providers across the island. I carefully designed maps for a non-specialist audience to present results. These are samples from a collection of maps that I made for the project.
