# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "This is a collaborative project between Westbank First Nation Archaeology and UBC Okanagan that focuses on enacting Indigenous data governance principles such as OCAPÂ® (ownership, control, access and possession) in syilx digital heritage. The principles can help guide appropriate ways to share syilx heritage beyond Westbank First Nation, while simultaneously reaffirming community ownership and possession of its digital heritage. This is one way to minimize the potential for misuse of syilx knowledge."

Through this joint fellowship, Nichole Vessie (Westbank First Nation Archaeology) and Dr Neha Gupta (UBC Okanagan) will develop a Web-based map that enables engagement and interaction with syilx digital heritage items. These public efforts are part of Westbank First Nation Archaeology's broader aims to monitor, preserve and govern heritage within [Westbank First Nation's] (https://www.wfn.ca/) area of responsibility.

 The collaboration is funded by the [UBC Okanagan Public Humanities Joint Fellowship] (https://public-humanities.ok.ubc.ca/2021/01/20/syilx-digital-heritage-governance/)
